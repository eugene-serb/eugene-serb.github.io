# Hi all!

This repository is my website for my repositories and projects, contact information and my biography, for my services and maybe, there will be a blog in the future.

I am making this site for myself and am learning how to do it. [Website](https://eugene-serb.github.io/)

This contains my other projects:
1. calculator — [rep](https://github.com/eugene-serb/calculator/), [page](https://eugene-serb.github.io/demos/calculator/)
2. sm-visualiser — [rep](https://github.com/eugene-serb/sm-visualiser/), [page](https://eugene-serb.github.io/demos/sm-visualiser/)

If you are interested in this or my other projects, or would like to suggest and share ideas with me, or just talk to me, contact me: *[@eugene_serb](https://twitter.com/eugene_serb)*
